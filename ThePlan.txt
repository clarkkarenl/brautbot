The plan (subject to change):

1. Download all Brautigan poetry from https://sites.google.com/site/brautiganarchives/home

2. Use map reduce to perform word incidence & count from all poetry
* use Shakespeare code & Cloudera Live to do this easily

3. Decide which words, if any, to throw out

4. Create source file from which "poems" will be generated
* Look at how dariusk has done this

5. Determine "rules" for poems
* haiku or free form w/ varying line lengths?

6. Write python code to generate poems

7. Write ??? to post poems to Twitter

8. After success case works, ensure coverage with test code, error handling, etc.
