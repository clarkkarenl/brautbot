I have Christmas dinner every year with Michael and he always cooks abalone curry It takes a long time because it tastes so good and the afternoon travels pleasantly by in his kitchen that is halfway between India and Atlantis

I just spent fifteen seconds staring at a Japanese fly my first He was standing on a red brick in the Mitsui Building Plaza enjoying the sun He didn't care that I was looking at him He was cleaning his face Perhaps he had a date with a beautiful lady fly his bride to be or maybe just good friends to have lunch a little later in Mitsui Plaza at noon 
I just spent the last half-an-hour watching a Japanese children's program on television There are millions of us here in Tokyo We know what we like

I lie here in a strange girl's apartment She has poison oak a bad sunburn and is unhappy She moves about the place like distant gestures of solemn glass She opens and closes things She turns the water on and she turns the water off All the sounds she makes are faraway They could be in a different city It is dusk and people are staring out the windows of that city Their eyes are filled with the sounds of what she is doing
I lift the toilet seat as if it were the nest of a bird and I see cat tracks all around the edge of the bowl
I like this taxi driver racing through the dark streets of Tokyo as if life had no meaning I feel the same way
I like to think and the sooner the better of a cybernetic meadow where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony like pure water touching clear sky I like to think right now please of a cybernetic forest filled with pines and electronics where deer stroll peacefully past computers as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms I like to think it has to be of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature returned to our mammal brothers and sisters and all watched over by machines of loving grace

I look out the car window at 100 kilometers an hour 62 miles and see a man peddling a bicycle very carefully down a narrow path between rice paddies He's gone in a few seconds I have only his memory now He has been changed into a 100 kilometer-an-hour memory ink rubbing

I saw a decadent gothic Japanese movie this evening It went so far beyond any decadence that I have ever seen before that I was transformed into a child learning for the first time that shadows are not always friendly that houses are haunted that people sometimes have thoughts made out of snake skin that crawl toward the innocence of sleeping babies The movie took place in Tokyo just before the earthquake on September 1 1923 In a gothic Japanese house a man was hiding inside a large stuffed red chair while a beautiful woman wearing exotic costumes made love to other men sitting in the chair The men did not know that somebody was hiding inside the chair feeling voyeuring every detail of their passion It took a long time in the movie before I realized that there was a man inside the chair The film went on and on into decadence after decadence like a rainbow of perversion I can't describe them all You would have trouble believing them The red chair was only a beginning I sat there transfixed with a hundred Japanese men It was as if we were the orgasm of spiders fucking in dried human blood

I sit here an arch-villain of romance thinking about you Gee I'm sorry I made you unhappy but there was nothing I could do about it because I have to be free Perhaps everything would have been different if you had stayed at the table or asked me to go out with you to look at the moon instead of getting up and leaving me alone with her

I stare at your tomato plants You're not I'm not pleased with the way they are growing I try to think of ways to help them I study them What do I know about tomatoes Perhaps some nitrate I suggest But I don't know anything and now I've taken to gossiping about them I'm as shameless as their lack of growing

I went to the castle to see the queen She was in the garden burning flowers I see you are here on time as always she said striking a match to an orchid The petals caught on fire and burned like the clothes of an angel I took out a knife and cut off my finger These flowers she said smiling don't they burn with a beautiful light
I woke up in the middle of the afternoon alone our love-making did not lead to going to bed together and that was OK I guess Beside the bed were my shoes covered with Meiji mud I looked at them and felt very good It's funny what the sight of dried mud can do to your mind

That's where I see your face baby on a tank all around the cannon
The act of death-defying affection insures the constancy of the stars and their place at the beginning of everything
The act of dying is like hitch-hiking into a strange town late at night where it is cold and raining and you are alone again Suddenly all the street lamps go out and everything becomes dark so dark that even the buildings are afraid of one another
The actresses without their makeup their costumes their roles are returned to being mortals I watch them eat quietly in a small inn They have no illusions almost plain like saints perfect in their re-entry
The alarm-colored shadow of a frightened ant wants to make friends with you learn all about your childhood cry together come live with you
The autumn river is cold and clear and fish hang in the deep water loving neither dreams nor reality The fish hang in the deep water and turn slowly like the pages in an old book of photographs
The Bullet Train is the famous Japanese express train that travels 120 miles an hour Lazarus is an old stand-by You listened to the ranting and raving drunken American writer on the Bullet Train from Nagoya as I blamed you for everything that ever went wrong in this world including the grotesque event that occurred that night in Gifu while you slept Of course you had done nothing but be my good friend At one point I told you to consider me dead that I was dead for you from that moment on I took your hand and touched my hand with it I told you that my flesh was now cold to you dead You silently nodded your head eyes filled with sadness I even forbid you to ever read one of my books again because I knew how much you loved them and again you nodded your head and you didn't say anything The sadness in your eyes did all the speaking The Bullet Train continued travelling at 120 miles an hour back to Tokyo as I ranted and raved at you You didn't say a word Your sadness filled the Bullet Train with two hundred extra passengers They were all reading newspapers that had no words printed on them only the dried tears of the dead By the time the train reached Tokyo Station my anger had turned slowly and was headed in all directions toward a deserved oblivion I took your hand and touched my hand again I'm alive for you I said The warmth has returned to my flesh You nodded silently again never having said a word The two hundred extra passengers remained on the train though it was the end of the line They will stay there forever riding back and forth until they are dust We stepped out into the early Tokyo morning friends again Oh thank you Tagawa Tadasu O beautiful human being for sharing and understanding my death and return from the dead on the Bullet Train between Nagoya and Tokyo the morning of June 8 1976 Later in the evening I called you on the telephone Your first words were Are you fine Yes I am fine
The cab takes me home through the Tokyo dawn I have been awake all night I will be asleep before the sun rises I will sleep all day The cab is a pillow the streets are blankets the dawn is my bed The cab rests my head I'm on my way to dreams
The carpenter built a prison ladder working hard all night long he built that ladder from owl-smelling cedar but he made a mistake he had an extra rung left over and it flew away
The Chinese read the time in the eyes of cats said Baudelaire and went into a jewelry store on Market Street He came out a few moments later carrying a twenty-one jewel Siamese cat that he wore on the end of a golden chain
The Chinese smoke opium in their bathrooms They all get in the bathroom and lock the door The old people sit in the tub and the children sit on the floor
The day they busted the Grateful Dead rain stormed against San Francisco like hot swampy scissors cutting Justice into the evil clothes that alligators wear The day they busted the Grateful Dead was like a flight of winged alligators carefully measuring marble with black rubber telescopes The day they busted the Grateful Dead turned like the wet breath of alligators blowing up balloons the size of the Hall of Justice
The desire in her eyes sits astride a rocking horse Her breasts are like little teacups And her vagina is an Easter bunny
The desks are silent as tombstones The chalkboard is coated with spider webs The erasers are ticking like bombs The recess bell has turned to mud etc I think you get the picture Nothing is being taught in the palace today
The distances of loneliness make the fourth dimension seem like three hungry crows looking at a worm in a famine
The gunman holds the wind in his hand Autumn and spring pass like robberies across his eyes He doesn't blink while one stops leaves and the other starts them The gunman is a friend to the changing of the seasons He holds the wind in his hand
The kittens of August are cats now and all the leaves have fallen from the two trees by the creek that were so short a time ago shade and now the hunters are sighting in their rifles for antelope deer bear elk and moose I can hear them methodically banging away at imaginary targets that will soon be made real
The last surprise is when you come gradually to realize that nothing surprises you any more
The moon is Hamlet on a motorcycle coming down a dark road He is wearing a black leather jacket and boots I have nowhere to go I will ride all night
The moon like mischievous bacon crisps its desire while I harbor myself toward two eggs over easy
The moon throws A shadow upon the night The shadow is as silent As the birth of a rose And the shadow is as soft As a butterfly's breath
The net wt of winter is 675 ozs and winter has a regular flavor with Fluoristan to stop tooth decay A month ago I bought a huge tube of Crest tooth paste and when I put it in the bathroom I looked at it and said Winter
The night is now half-gone youth goes I am in bed alone Sappho My books have been translated into Norwegian French Danish Romanian Spanish Japanese Dutch Swedish Italian German Finnish Hebrew and published in England but I will sleep alone tonight in Tokyo raining
The only hope we have is our children and the seeds we give them and the gardens we plant together
The only thing that you can do to gain back some human dignity after you crap in bed like a baby is to pretend that you are Hannibal crossing the Alps
The petals of the vagina unfold like Christopher Columbus taking off his shoes Is there anything more beautiful than the bow of a ship touching a new world
The river of mourners had stopped moving for a moment All it would have to do would be to start moving right now and that black ant would be at its own funeral Then the ant started crawling toward the man's left shoe with all intent to pass under this shoe as it had done with the right shoe I looked up from the ant to the head of the procession motionless outside the funeral home The procession still wasn't moving but it was a long distance between that man's legs for an ant to crawl over to and under the left shoe and the future itself is as fragile and uncertain as that ant's journey The procession paused like stationary black glass just long enough for that ant to make it under the man's shoe and into the future and then the procession moved effortlessly like a night flowing river into Aoyama Saijoh Good-bye Terayama Shuji
The sea is like an old nature poet who died of a heart attack in a public latrine His ghost still haunts the urinals At night he can be heard walking around barefooted in the dark Somebody stole his shoes
The sexual accident that turned out to be your wife the mother of your children and the end of your life is home cooking dinner for all your friends
The smell of vegetables on a cold day performs faithfully an act of reality like a knight in search of the holy grail or a postman on a rural route looking for a farm that isn't there Carrots peppers and berries Nerval Baudelaire and Rimbaud
The snow on the cow The cow has no shadow The cow has turned to snow
The sweet juices of your mouth are like castles bathed in honey I've never had it done so gently before You have put a circle of castles around my penis and you swirl them like sunlight on the wings of birds
The telephone rings in San Francisco This is Ultra Violet I don't know her except that she is a movie actress She wants to talk to me She has a nice voice We talk for a while Then she has to go someplace Good-bye
The thought of her hands touching his hair makes me want to vomit
The time is right to mix sentences sentences with dirt and the sun with punctuation and the rain with verbs and for worms to pass through question marks and the stars to shine down on budding nouns and the dew to form on paragraphs
The twelve red berries
The umbilical cord cannot be refastened and life flow through it again Our tears never totally dry Our first kiss is now a ghost haunting our mouths as they fade toward oblivion
The wheel it's a thing like pears rotting under a tree in August O golden wilderness The bees travel in covered wagons and the Indians hide in the heat
The world has a magic direction in the twilight It is a place of spells and visions Look out of the window Do you see the old woman with the plum tree on her back She is walking up Hyde Street She appears to be lost and I think she is crying A taxi comes along She stops the taxi and gets in with the plum tree She is gone now and the evening star shines in the sky
The world was opening and closing its insane asylums and churches like a forgetful old man buttoning up his pants instead of unbuttoning them Are you going to go to the toilet in your pants old man The rain was a dark Ferris wheel bringing us closer to Baudelaire and General Motors We were famous and we kicked walnut leaves
The young Japanese woman cashier who doesn't like me I don't know why I've done nothing to her except exist uses a calculator to add up the checks at a speed that approaches light clickclickclickclickclickclickclickclick she adds up her dislike for me
There are comets that flash through our mouths wearing the grace of oceans and galaxies God knows we try to do the best we can There are comets connected to chemicals that telescope down out tongues to burn out against the air I know we do There are comets that laugh at us from behind our teeth wearing the clothes of fish and birds We try
There are days when our cat becomes the doors and windows of the house To go into the bedroom I must open a wooden cat that has an iron mouse in its claws and to look out the window at the sky I must peer through the stomach of a cat digesting is it a bird
There are days when that is the last place in the world where you want to be but you have to be there like a movie because it features you
There are doors that want to be free from their hinges to fly with perfect clouds There are windows that want to be released from their frames to run with the deer through back country meadows There are walls that want to prowl with the mountains through the early morning dusk There are floors that want to digest their furniture into flowers and trees There are roofs that want to travel gracefully with the stars through circles of darkness
There are no postage stamps that send letters back to England three centuries ago no postage stamps that make letters travel back until the grave hasn't been dug yet and John Donne stands looking out the window it is just beginning to rain this April morning and the birds are falling into the trees like chess pieces into an unplayed game and John Donne sees the postman coming up the street the postman walks very carefully because his cane is made of glass
There are three quail in a cage next door and they are the sweet delight of our mornings calling to us like small frosted cakes bobwhitebobwhitebobwhite but at night they drive our God-damn cat Jake crazy They run around that cage like pinballs as he stands out there smelling their asses through the wire
There is a motorcycle in New Mexico
There is a woman on the Klamath River who has five hundred children in the basement stuffed like hornets into a mud nest Great Sparrow is their father Once a day he pulls a red wagon between them and that's all they know
There is darkness on your lantern and pumpkins in your wind and Oh they clutter up your mind with their senseless bumping while your heart is like a sea gull frozen into a long distance telephone call I'd like to take the darkness off your lantern and change the pumpkins into sky fields of ordered comets and disconnect the refrigerator telephone that frightens your heart into standing still
There is no difference between Tokyo and New York These men do not look like their photographs These are different men I'm not being fooled in the least Complete strangers drive these cabs
There is so much lost and so much gained in these words
There is something wrong with this poem Can you find it
There was a darkness upon the darkness and only the death growth was growing It grew like the darkness upon darkness growing
They are really having fun drinking glasses of wine and talking about things that they like
They said that my telephone would be fixed by 6 They guaranteed it
Things slowly curve out of sight until they are gone Afterwards only the curve remains
Thinking hard about you I got onto the bus and paid 30 cents car fare and asked the driver for two transfers before discovering that I was alone
This is the biggest Big Dipper that I've ever seen
This morning I was wondering when I would see my first bird in Japan I was betting my mental money on a sparrow when I heard a rooster crowing from a backyard in the Shibuya District of Tokyo and that took care of that
This morning there was a knock at the door You answered it The mailman was standing there He slapped your face
This poem was found written on a paper bag by Richard Brautigan in a laundromat in San Francisco The author is unknown By accident you put Your money in my Machine By accident I put My money in another Machine On purpose I put Your clothes in the Empty machine full Of water and no Clothes It was lonely
Three crates of Private Eye Lettuce the name and drawing of a detective with magnifying glass on the sides of the crates of lettuce form a great cross in man's imagination and his desire to name the objects of this world I think I'll call this place Golgotha and have some salad for dinner
Thunder roared across the sky like the voice of an angry man Rain started falling slowly at first then faster and faster and louder and louder The man became silent The voices of the rain chattered like little children at a birthday party
Too many lifetimes like this one right Hungover surrounded by general goofiness lonely can't get it up I feel just like a pile of bleached cat shit
Torn apart by the storms of love and put back together by the calms of love I lie here in a harbor that does not know where your body ends and my body begins Fish swim between our ribs and sea gulls cry like mirrors to our blood
Toward the pleasures of a reconstituted crow I collect darkness within myself like the shadow of a blind lighthouse
Travelling along a freeway in Tokyo I saw a woman's face reflected back to us from a small circular mirror on the passenger side of the car in front of us The car had a regular rearview mirror in the center of the front window I wondered what the circular mirror was doing on the passenger side of the car Her face was in it She was directly in front of us She had a beautiful face floating in an unreal mirror on a Tokyo freeway Her face stayed there for a while and then floated off forever in the changing traffic She moves like a ghost She is not alive any more She must be in her late sixties She is short and squat like a Japanese stereotype She takes care of the lobby of the hotel She empties the ashtrays She dusts and mops things She moves like a ghost She has no human expression A few days ago I was standing beside three Japanese businessmen peeing in the lavatory We each had our own urinal She walked in like a ghost and started mopping the toilet floor around us She was totally unaware of us standing there urinating She was truly a ghost and we were suddenly ghost pee-ers as she mopped on by
Turn a candle inside out and you've got the smallest portion of a lion standing there at the edge of the shadows
Two guys get out of a car They stand beside it They don't know what else to do
Two words Camelot gone
Umbrallaing herself like a poorly-designed angel she falls in love again destined to a broken heart which is the way it always is for her I'm glad she's not falling in love with me
Vicky sleeps out in the woods with dead people but she always combs her hair in the morning Her parents don't understand her And she doesn't understand them They try She tries The dead people try They will all work it out someday
Waiting for her  Nothing to do but write a poem She is now 5 minutes late I have a feeling that she will be at least 15 minutes late It is now 6 minutes after 9 PM in Tokyo NOW exactly NOW the doorbell rang She is at the door 6 minutes after 9 PM in Tokyo nothing has changed except that she is here
Walking on crow eggs mama listening to the shells break like cars being parked on asphalt
Watching Japanese television two young women in kimonos are standing beside a biplane That's right an old timey airplane A man is interviewing them They are having a very animated and happy conversation I wish I knew Japanese because I will never know why they are standing next to a biplane but they will stand there forever in my mind happy pilots in their kimonos waiting to take off
We age in darkness like wood and watch our phantoms change their clothes of shingles and boards for a purpose that can only be described as wood
We all lose a few
We all waved as his boat sailed away The old people cried The children were restless
We are a coast people There is nothing but ocean out beyond us Jack Spicer I sit here dreaming long thoughts of California at the end of a November day below a cloudy twilight near the Pacific listening to the Mamas and the Papas THEY'RE GREAT singing a song about breaking somebody's heart and digging it I think I'll get up and dance around the room Here I go
We are in a kitchen in Santa Fe New Mexico Some bacon is frying It smells like a character that you like in a good movie A beautiful girl is watching the bacon
We did not play the game We played the rules perfectly no violations no penalties The game is over or is it just beginning
We lay in that bed one sunny evening after making love and decided to name our first girl Cat we were going to name her Cat but now we have departed forever from our love-making and we will not have a little girl nor any children at all and I am doomed to become the poet in your dreams who falls continually like the evening rain
We meet We try Nothing happens but afterwards we are always embarrassed when we see each other We look away
We stopped at perfect days and got out of the car The wind glanced at her hair It was as simple as that I turned to say something
We walked along the pier that curved like Einstein's breakfast out into eternity and there were people fishing off the pier mostly Chinese Mike ran up to an old woman and asked her if she liked to kill fish to murder living things and she smiled at him her mouth going on forever
We were the eleven o'clock news because while the rest of the world was going to hell we made love
Wearing a grey cowboy-style sort of formal Western jacket given to me by Peter Fonda's wife Becky in Montana You have to dress up sometimes and on the right sleeve a borrowed black armband from Shiina Takako here in Tokyo This is perfectly all right But I don't want to offend anyone I reply You won't offend anyone This is all right But I'm a foreigner I reply It's all right and so then I go to my very first funeral ever I've never been to a funeral in my land of America and I start walking toward Aoyama Saijoh Maybe a kilometer away On a very hot afternoon To my first funeral  and then I'm in the current of the night flowing river waiting to flow inside Aoyama Saijoh to say good-bye to Terayama Shuji I've never been very good at figuring out the volume of large groups but there must have been thousands of people there dressed in black flowing inside to place a white chrysanthemum in front of his memory There were so many of us that we had to wait outside in the hot sun before we could go inside I've never been to a more quieter place than the silence of so many people moving like a night flowing river It was so quiet that I saw a black ant crawl under a man's shoe in front of me The ant crawled under the right shoe passing between the heel and the sole The funeral-black shoe was like a midnight bridge over the ant Then the ant was inbetween the man's legs
We're cooking dinner tonight I'm making a kind of Stonehenge stroganoff Marcia is helping me You already know the legend of her beauty I've asked her to rub garlic on the meat She takes each piece of meat like a lover and rubs it gently with garlic I've never seen anything like this before Every orifice of the meat is explored caressed relentlessly with garlic There is a passion here that would drive a deaf saint to learn the violin and play Beethoven at Stonehenge
What a good time fancy like a leisure white interior with long yellow curtains I'll take it to sleep with me tonight and hope that my dreams are built toward beautiful blonde women eating indirect popcorn
When dreams wake life ends Then dreams are gone Life is gone
When he died he left his wife three gas stations and a warehouse He left his mistress two supermarkets
When he went out the door he said he wasn't coming back but he came back the son- ofabitch and now I'm pregnant and he won't get off his ass
When I was a child I had a graveyard where I buried insects and dead birds under a rose tree I would bury the insects in tin foil and match boxes I would bury the birds in pieces of red cloth It was all very sad and I would cry as I scooped the dirt into their small graves with a spoon Baudelaire would come and join in my insect funerals saying little prayers the size of dead birds
When I was hitch-hiking down to Big Sur Moby Dick stopped and picked me up He was driving a truckload of sea gulls to San Luis Obispo Do you like being a truckdriver better than you do a whale I asked Yeah Moby Dick said Hoffa is a lot better to us whales than Captain Ahab ever was The old fart
When I was six years old I played Chinese checkers with a woman who was ninety-three years old She lived by herself in an apartment down the hall from ours We played Chinese checkers every Monday and Thursday nights While we played she usually talked about her husband who had been dead for seventy years and we drank tea and ate cookies and cheated
When she was fifteen if you'd told her that when she was twenty she'd be going to bed with bald-headed men and liking it she would have thought you very abstract
When the moon shines like a dead garage I travel with gasoline ghosts down all those haunted miles of the past twenty-seven Model A miles an hour in 1939 going to where I have forgotten
When we were children after the war we lived for a year in a house next to a large highway There were many sawmills and log ponds on the otherside of the highway The sound of the saws could be heard most of the time and when there was darkness trash burners glowed red against the sky We did not have a father and our mother had to work very hard My sister and I got our spending money by gathering beer bottles that had been thrown along the highway or left around the sawmills At first we carried the bottles in gunny sacks and cardboard boxes but later we found an old baby buggy and we used that to carry our bottles in We took the bottles to a grocery store and were paid a penny for small beer bottles and two cents for large ones On almost any day we could be seen pushing our baby buggy along the highway looking for beer bottles
When you take your pill it's like a mine disaster I think of all the people lost inside of you
Where I come from it's just another carrot in the patch Where do you come from stranger
Where you are now I will join you
While they talked the seven-year-old girl listened quietly and her eyes were like mice hiding in the hay The twelve Roman soldiers stared at her naked body Each one of them had a long silver spear and it shone brightly in the moonlight The Roman soldiers stood in a circle around the girl with their spears pointed towards her Then one of them stabbed his silver spear in the ground and he came slowly to the girl and he touched her with all his body Then the other soldiers came and the girl did not cry Afterwards as she walked home she could hear a nightingale singing but she did not know where It seemed all around her When she got home her mother kissed her on the cheek and gave her an oatmeal cookie from a blue jar and while the girl ate the cookie her mother told how strange and beautiful the world was
Why is it when I walk past funeral parlors they remind me of the smell of fresh paint and I can feel the smell in my stomach It does not feel like food
With his hat on he's about five inches taller than a taxicab
With so short a time to live and think about stuff I've spent just about the right amount of time on this butterfly 
With the rain falling surgically against the roof I ate a dish of ice cream that looked like Kafka's hat It was a dish of ice cream tasting like an operating table with the patient staring up at the ceiling
Yes that's the table where Captain Martin sat Yes that one By the window He would sit there alone for hours at a time staring out at the sea He always had one plain doughnut and a cup of coffee I don't know what he was looking at
Yesterday my wife divorced me in Brazil and the rain highway saw my youth have a flat tire leaving me free to marry Emily Dickinson O what profound love we will make together our gentle hands moving like gravestones and our coming will be like a funeral procession
You have your friends I have mine
You were the prettiest girl in your high school graduating class in 1927 Now you have short blue hair and nobody loves you not even your own children They don't like to have you around because you make them nervous
You will have unreal recollections of me like half-developed photographs for all the days of your life even though you have never met me because I have dreamt you Soon it will be morning the dream over
Your love Somebody else needs it I don't
Your necklace is leaking and blue light drips from your beads to cover your beautiful breasts with a clear African dawn
You've got some Star-Spangled nails in your coffin kid That's what they've done for you son
Yup A long lazy September look in the mirror says it's true I'm 31 and my nose is growing old It starts about an inch below the bridge and strolls geriatrically down for another inch or so stopping Fortunately the rest of the nose is comparatively young I wonder if girls will want me with an old nose I can hear them now the heartless bitches He's cute but his nose is old
ZAP unlaid for 20 days my sexual image isn't worth a shit If I were dead I couldn't attract a female fly
